# API Documentation

The API documentation provides the details of the API endpoints and their usage. The API documentation will be generated using either [Swagger](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) or [Scalar](https://scalar.com/).

Each of them provides the following information:

1. List of all the API endpoints.
2. Details of each API endpoint.
3. Request and response models.
4. Request and response examples.
5. Ability to test the API endpoints.
6. Ability to export the API documentation.
